# Will the MTA's OMNY Rollout Leave Reduced Fare Riders Behind?

In 2017, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) announced plans to phase out physical MetroCards and replace them with a contactless fare payment system. The new system, eventually dubbed OMNY, would allow subway and bus riders to pay fares using digital wallets, contactless credit or debit cards, and, eventually, physical OMNY cards capable of tap-to-pay. The MetroCard phase-out was planned to be completed in 2023, but delays have pushed the expected completion date back indefinitely.

While OMNY might promise a bit of much-needed modernization to New York City’s transit system, the rollout has also raised concerns that some classes of reduced-fare riders will be left behind. The MTA currently offers two reduced-fare options:

Seniors & Disability, for riders who are 65 and older or have a qualifying disability; and
Fair Fares, for low-income riders.

Until OMNY, reduced-fare riders paid with a special MetroCard. But with the OMNY rollout’s emphasis on contactless payment methods, which require a smartphone or contactless credit or debit card to use, will these riders still be able to access their benefits? Among adults with household incomes below $30,000 per year, smartphone ownership [is only 76%](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/06/22/digital-divide-persists-even-as-americans-with-lower-incomes-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/). Among seniors, [it’s only 61%](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/13/share-of-those-65-and-older-who-are-tech-users-has-grown-in-the-past-decade/).

Furthermore, reduced-fare riders are busy people. They might not have the time or resources to go through the effort of linking their benefits to a contactless payment method, or to seek out one of the 87 subway stations that sells physical OMNY cards. (A year ago, only six stations sold OMNY cards. And before that, the cards were only sold at select retailers like CVS and Walgreens.)

Considering the inconvenience that OMNY has so far presented to reduced-fare riders, have these customers been slower to adopt OMNY than those paying full fare? Has the phased OMNY rollout prepared riders for the eventual discontinuation of MetroCards?

Using the MTA’s Subway Hourly Ridership dataset, which tallies ridership by station and fare type since February 2022, we can answer these questions. Also, by comparing ridership to demographic data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we can estimate the share of eligible riders who use reduced-fare programs, for both MetroCard and OMNY, to determine if utilization differs between the groups.

Understanding how effectively (or ineffectively) the OMNY rollout has reached reduced-fare riders is critical for making sure seniors, low-income riders, and riders with disabilities aren’t left behind.

Since OMNY readers were first installed in subway stations in 2019, it has become the preferred payment method of New York City subway riders. Meanwhile, traditional MetroCard swipes have been on the decline. In early 2024, OMNY ridership finally surpassed MetroCard:
