## So you're interested in learning more about me? Well, shucks!

My name is Jonah.  

I'm a Data Analyst currently specializing in healthcare policy research.  

In 2022, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from UCLA with a B.S. in Statistics and a minor in Digital Humanities (think "Statistics meets Social Studies" - check it out [here](https://dh.ucla.edu/undergraduate-minor/)!).  

### Why data?  

My interest in data analysis starts from the principle that humans are worse than we'd like to admit at thinking about complicated problems. We're over-confident, short-sighted, and forgetful. We [ignore evidence we don't like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics) and [claim to be rational when we're actually thinking with our guts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism). If this is the case (and it is), how can we expect to get anything done?  

To me, analytics is one of the solutions to our flawed thinking. When it comes to answering questions about everything from climate change to market forecasts, there is a right answer, no matter what our error-prone minds think about it. If we want to have a shot at arriving at that answer&mdash;the signal in the noise, so to speak&mdash;it's important to put our intuitions aside, open our minds, and ask What do the numbers actually say?  

### Data for good?

I believe that data can help organizations be as effective as possible with their resources. My goal is to help mission-driven organizations be effective in creating positive impact, which is why I've worked with nonprofits like the [Local Initiatives Support Corporation](https://lisc.org), [Imagine LA](https://imaginela.org), [916 Ink](https://916ink.org), as well as social impact strategy firm [Third Plateau](https://thirdplateau.com).  

### What else?  

When I'm not analyzing data or pontificating about analytics, I'm usually reading, eating, or exploring NYC. I love watching basketball (go Kings!) and sometimes even do [projects](https://github.com/jonah916/NBA-Playoff-Predictions-2022/blob/main/NBA%20Playoff%20Predictions%20with%20K%20Means%20Clustering.ipynb) about it. I'm also a huge fan of movies and write the occasional review over on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jonah916/). I've dabbled in podcast producing and writing down my thoughts on the issue of the day, which you can check out on the [Other Projects](https://jonah916.github.io/other%20projects) page.
