When the Denver Nuggets won Game 5 of the 2023 Finals to clinch the NBA championship, it didn’t take long for folks on the internet to try putting an asterisk on the achievement. The most common critique was that the Nuggets had an easy run to the title by drawing weak playoff opponents, including a Conference Finals matchup with the 7th-seed Lakers and a date in the Finals with the 8th-seed Miami Heat, only the second 8th-seed to ever make the Finals. One Reddit user [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/165fk8w/the_denver_nuggets_were_the_first_team_since_the/) that Denver is the first team since 1976 to win a championship without beating a single 50-win team.

Never mind that Denver’s championship came on the shoulders of a [historic playoff run](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/06/13/nikola-jokic-2023-nba-finals-mvp-nuggets-heat#:~:text=Additionally%2C%C2%A0Joki%C4%87%E2%80%99s%C2%A0feats%20in%20the%20Finals%2C%20which%20included%20the%C2%A0first%2Dever%2030/20/10%20performance%2C%20capped%20a%20tear%20where%20he%20also%C2%A0set%20the%20record%20for%20the%C2%A0most%20playoff%20triple%2Ddoubles%C2%A0(10).%20The%202023%20MVP%20runner%2Dup%20finished%20the%20playoffs%20averaging%2030%20PPG%2C%2013.5%20RPG%20and%209.5%20APG.) by Nikola Jokic—he recorded a triple-double in half of his team’s 20 playoff games—or that the runner-up Miami Heat were no joke, having knocked off the 1- and 2-seed in the East to get to the Finals. The haters’ analysis overlooks a key detail, which is that the NBA is in the middle of an era of competitive balance, where the gap between the best teams and the middle of the pack (and between the middle of the pack and the basement-dwellers) is small in historical terms. It’s been a few seasons since we’ve seen any eye-popping team [records](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/12f88le/no_team_will_hit_60_wins_for_the_first_82game_nba/). Betting markets have had flatter championship [odds](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-champs/#Finals) in recent years, and a different team has won the title in each of the last five seasons, the first time that’s happened [since 1977-81](https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1668646095864381440).

The recent trend towards parity places last season’s Nuggets team in an unusual context. There were only six teams in 2022-23, including Denver, that won 50 games, which is tied for the sixth fewest 50-win teams in a season when accounting for the number of teams in the league.

The Nuggets didn’t draw any 50-win teams in the playoffs because there weren’t many 50-win teams to draw in the first place. Rather than using this as a reason to dunk on them, I think it’s worth trying to understand this dynamic so we can appreciate what it means for the past, present, and future of the NBA. How has the level of competitive parity changed throughout NBA history? Why do these changes occur? And what do the answers portend for the future of basketball?

## Measuring Parity
Before we can talk about parity, we need a way to measure it. There is clearly a different dynamic at play in a season like 2022-23, when only six teams across the whole league surpassed 50 wins, than a season like 2009-2010, when there were eight 50-win teams in the Western Conference alone. Is it possible to sum up these different dynamics in one number?

One metric that works fairly well is the standard deviation (SD) of team win percentage. In broad terms, the difference between balanced and imbalanced seasons is the spread of team quality: Are the good teams much better than the bad teams? Or are teams more clustered around the middle of the pack? Taking the SD of team win percentage shows us how close the average team in a given season is to winning 50% of its games. A low SD indicates more parity, as more teams hover around that 50% benchmark, while a high SD reflects more teams rising to the top or sinking to the bottom.
